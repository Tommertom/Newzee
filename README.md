# .Newzee  easy Newsreader
.Newzee is a simple and smart newsreader which takes feeds from popular sources
and allows the user to swiftly browse through the newsitems.

Some of the features are:
* set/unset favorite items - these will stay on the list until you unfavorite or swipe
* easy selection of feeds per topic and on the fly unsubscribe if needed
* direct deeplinking - if you press and hold an item, you will directly go to the article on the web
* many newsservices which you can easily select and unselect
* social sharing of news
* no issues on cors.

## Todo
* work on the HTTP headers for optimisation

Some known issues:
* code cleaning and sanitise for security (injecting of code)
